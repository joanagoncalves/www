## Intro

I am an [ERCIM / Marie Curie postdoctoral fellow](http://fellowship.ercim.eu) at the Centre for Computer Science and Mathematics in the Netherlands ([CWI](http://www.cwi.nl)). My background is computer science and I do research in data mining for interesting problems in biology and beyond. I specialise in combinatorial pattern mining for biclustering and triclustering of time series data.
