I am in the Program Committee of BioKDD 2015, the 14th International Workshop on Data Mining in Bioinformatics. This workshop is co-located with KDD (the largest conference in data mining) and the best papers are published in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB).
