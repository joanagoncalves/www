The paper describing a major update to the Yeastract database has been made available online ahead of print by Nucleic Acids Research: [`article`](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2014.2312007) [`website`](http://www.yeastract.com). Besides the inclusion of additional TF-target interactions, this update integrates the **TFRank** method for prioritising key transcription factors potentially involved in the regulation of a set of genes of interest: [`article`](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/BTR546) [`software`](http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/software/tfrank).

**Yeastract** is a database and set of tools for the analysis and prediction of transcription regulatory associations in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.
