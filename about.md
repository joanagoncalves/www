## Short biography

In October 2014 I joined both the Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics group at the Delft University of Technology ([PRB-TUDelft](http://prb.tudelft.nl)) and the Computational Cancer Biology group at The Netherlands Cancer Institute ([CCB-NKI](http://ccb.nki.nl)) as a postdoctoral fellow, working with Lodewyk Wessels. The year before I was as an [ERCIM / Marie Curie postdoctoral fellow](http://fellowship.ercim.eu) in the Algorithmic Computational Biology group led by Gunnar Klau at the Netherlands Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science ([CWI](http://www.cwi.nl)). Previously, I received a PhD in computer science from the [Technical University of Lisbon](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt). I conducted my doctoral researcher at [INESC-ID](http://www.inesc-id.pt) (Portugal), and was a visiting scholar at the [University of Leuven](http://www.kuleuven.be) (Belgium). My research interests include algorithms, data mining, machine learning and computational biology. I specialise in combinatorial pattern mining for biclustering and triclustering of time series data.

## Research topics

I develop data mining methods for relevant problems arising in diverse application domains. Currently, my research topics are:

+ local pattern mining and subspace clustering (of time series data)
+ integrative mining of heterogeneous data
+ construction of global models from local patterns

## Application domains

Most of my research has been applied to molecular biology and functional genomics to further the understanding of biological processes, and perturbations of these leading to disease. In particular, I have addressed the analysis of gene expression, TF-target binding or protein interaction data, as well as combinations of these, to identify patterns and functional modules putatively involved in:

+ response of yeast to different environmental stresses (microbiology)
+ pathologies in human, namely cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (biomedicine)

My plan is to expand the application domain of my research to other fields in the future:

+ economic and financial sciences (e.g. health insurance, fraud detection)
+ social science (e.g. behavioral patterns, information and disease spreading - epidemiology)
+ education and research (e.g. impact of funding in research, return on investment)
